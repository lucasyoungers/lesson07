                    <h3>Aurora Borealis</h3>
                    <p>Excited electrons and magnetic fields cause the Aurora Broealis.</p>
                    <p>The ethereal glow comes from collisions between fast moving electrons from
                        the magnetosphere (the region of space controlled by Earth’s magnetic field) and oxygen and
                        nitrogen molecules in our upper atmosphere. Electrons transfer some of their energy to these
                        molecules when they collide; this transfer of energy is said to “excite” them. An excited
                        molecule
                        eventually returns to its non-excited state by releasing photons, or light particles. Large
                        numbers
                        of these collisions create enough light for us to see.</p>

                    <h3>Snowflakes</h3>
                    <p>It's a myth that no two snowflakes are exactly the same.</p>
                    <p>In 1988, a scientist found two identical snow crystals. They came from a
                        storm in Wisconsin.</p>
                    <p>The largest snowflake might have been 15 inches wide.</p>
                    <p>According to some sources, the largest snowflakes ever observed fell during
                        a snowstorm in January 1887 at Montana’s Fort Keogh. While witnesses said the flakes were
                        “larger
                        than milk pans,” these claims have not been substantiated.

                    <h3>Ice</h3>
                    <p>The cryosphere is what we call ice on earth.</p>
                    <p>Ice on Earth is called the "chryoshphere" and the NOAA breaks it down as the “frozen water part
                        of
                        the Earth system.” Cryo comes from the Greek for cold, “kryos.” It includes not only all types
                        of
                        frozen water, but permafrost, which is soil that has existed below freezing for extended
                        periods of
                        time, but doesn’t necessarily have any water.</p>

                    <h3>Snowflakes</h3>
                    <p>Snowflakes are not the only type of snow.</p>
                    <p>Snow can also precipitate as graupel or sleet. Not to be confused with hail,
                        graupel (or snow pellets) are opaque ice particles that form in the atmosphere as ice crystals
                        fall
                        through freezing cloud droplets—meaning cloud particles that are colder than the freezing point
                        of
                        water but remain liquid. The cloud droplets group together to form a soft, lumpy mass. Sleet,
                        on
                        the other hand, consists of drops of rain that freeze into small, translucent balls of ice as
                        they
                        fall from the sky.</p>

                    <h3>Snow Colors</h3>
                    <p>Deep snow can often appear blue. This is because layers of snow can create a filter for the
                        light,
                        causing more red light to be absorbed than blue light. The result is that deeper snow appears
                        blue—think about how your snowy footprints compare to the surrounding landscape.
                    </p>
                    <p>Snow can also sometimes appear pink. Snow in high alpine areas and the coastal polar regions
                        contains cryophilic fresh-water algae that have a red pigment that tints the surrounding snow.</p>

                    <p>The scientific name for the Arctic Wolf is Canis Lupus Arcticus.</p>
                    <p>Arctic wolves are a subspecies of Gray Wolves.</p>
                    <p>Their habitat is the northern most regions of North America and the north and east shores of
                        Greenland.</p>
                    <p>The soil in their habitat for the most part stays frozen year round, a condition called
                        permafrost,
                        which makes it impossible to dig dens. These animals find shelter in caves and rock coverings.</p>
